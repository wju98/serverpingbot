# Is Maintenance Over?

This discord bot will ping users when a Maplestory maintenance ends. Any user that reacts to the message generated by "!react" will be on the list of people the bot will ping. The end of a maintenance is detected when all 3 login servers are online after being in an offline state for at least 30 minutes. In order to be in an online state, all 3 login servers must respond to a ping. If any login server fails to do so, the login servers are considered to be offline.

--------------------

**Important Note:** This bot is only accurate for **maintenances**, not patch updates. Patch updates include updating the game's client which requires downloading and installing the new patch. Towards the end of the patch update, the patch will be available for download before login servers are turned online.
